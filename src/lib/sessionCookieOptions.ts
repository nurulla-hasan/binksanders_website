 * Returns the base cookie options for session cookies (accessToken, refreshToken, guestId).
 *
 * The `secure` flag MUST be `false` when the request is served over plain HTTP
 * (e.g. localhost in dev, or an HTTP staging server). Browsers silently drop
 * `secure` cookies on non-HTTPS connections, which is why login cookies were
 * not being set. On HTTPS we keep `secure: true` for safety.
 *
 * `httpOnly` keeps the token out of client-side JS, and `sameSite: "lax"`
 * prevents CSRF while still allowing top-level navigations to send the cookie.
